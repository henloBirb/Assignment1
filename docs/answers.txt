(a):
	hayde@DESKTOP-BV2M7KG MINGW64 ~/Documents/CEN4020/Assignment1 (master)
	$ git status
	On branch master
	Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
	  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

	nothing to commit, working tree clean

(b):
	hayde@DESKTOP-BV2M7KG MINGW64 ~/Documents/CEN4020/Assignment1/docs (master)
	$ git rev-list --count origin/master
	4

	I also tried "git log", saw two commits previously made and my own two along with comments.

(c):
	Here's how I got it using the notes:
	hayde@DESKTOP-BV2M7KG MINGW64 ~/Documents/CEN4020/Assignment1 (master)
	$ git log --follow ./.gitignore
	commit 69281a35557fd1226cbfc11428068c5d8bcf8466

	Here's what I found online to double-check:
	git ls-files -z | xargs -0 -n1 -I{} -- git log -1 --format="%ai {}" {}

(d):
	Branches are used in a Git repository so that you can seaprate your workflow and tackle 
	different problems. It allows you to check out code on a separate branch and allows for 
	multiple people ot be working on different branches at any given point in time. It allows 
	you to test new features as well in a separate branch that youi can later merge if it works 
	out.

(e):
	"git log" gets info regarding the changes and notes from previous commits.
	"git status" is used to check the current status of a repository.

(f):
	git log --follow ./Weapon.h

(g):
	git log --grep=file

(h):
	Inheritence:	The principle of creating classes that can be inherited from. "Is-A" 
					relationships.
	Polymorphism:	Having functions share the same name with different funtionality in 
					sublasses. Interface is the same, implementation is different. 
	Encapsulation:	The principle of hiding the implementation of data from the user.

(i):
	The main difference between the "Dictator and Lieutenants" workflow and the 
	"Integration Management" workflow would be that rather than an integration
	manager, the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow has lieutenants that resolve
	conflicts for a few (not all) developers and the Dictator merges the lieutenant
	changes and is the only person who can push them.

(j):
	A team of 100 developers would benefir from the "Dictator and Lieutenants" workflow
	as opposed to the "Centralized Workflow" becuase rather than having each individual
	developer responsible for pulling changes to the central repository and resolving
	conflicts (which for 100 devs would mean many frequent changes so by the time you
	resolve your conflict another change may have been added), you break it up and have
	the lieutenants merge for a few developers and the dictator merge the lieutenants. 
	It reminds me of a Big O of log(n) algo in it's approach. The D&L method is more
	attractive the more developers you have.
